I see many people being stuck in what they do. There is a lack of energy and
motivation to move forward, learn new stuff, feed their curiosity and grow.

I want to help people to get unstuck, to find their passion, to learn new
things, and be driven by curiosity and growth.

# Values

When I help out people and organisations, I live by the following values:

-   **Sharing Knowledge**: I have experienced that sharing knowledge is the best
    way to grow.
-   **Curiosity**: I am curious about how things work and how they can be
    improved.
-   **Quality Without Compromise**: I strive for the best quality in everything
    I do.
-   **Customer Intimacy**: I want to understand the needs of my customers and
    help them to grow. This means I will not hold back in sharing my knowledge
    and experience.
